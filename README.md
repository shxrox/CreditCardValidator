# Credit Card Validator üí≥

This Python script checks if a credit card number is valid using the **Luhn algorithm**.

## How it works

The program:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Asks the user to enter a credit card number (spaces or dashes allowed).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Reverses the number.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Sums all digits in odd positions (from the right).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Doubles all digits in even positions (from the right). If doubling results in a two-digit number, its digits are summed (or add 1 + remainder of dividing by 10).  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Adds both sums.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ If the total modulo 10 is 0, the card is **VALID**. Otherwise, it is **INVALID**.
